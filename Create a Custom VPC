Sure, let's dive into the detailed steps for each part of the setup:

### 1. Create a Custom VPC:

1.1. Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the VPC Dashboard.

1.2. Click on "Create VPC".
																	 
1.3. Fill in the following details:
   - **Name tag**: Enter a name for your VPC (e.g., MyCustomVPC).
   - **CIDR block**: Define the IP address range for your VPC (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16).
   - **Tenancy**: Choose the default tenancy unless you have specific requirements.
   
1.4. Click "Create".

### 2. Launch EC2 Instance:

2.1. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.

2.2. Click on "Launch Instance".

2.3. Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) (e.g., Amazon Linux 2).

2.4. Select an instance type based on your requirements.

2.5. Configure instance details:
   - **Network**: Select the VPC you created earlier.
   - **Subnet**: Choose a subnet within your VPC (preferably a public subnet for web servers).
   - **Auto-assign Public IP**: Enable for instances accessible from the internet.
   - Configure other settings as per your requirements.

2.6. Add storage, tags, and configure security groups (allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic from anywhere).

2.7. Review and launch the instance.

### 3. Set Up Application Load Balancer (ALB):

3.1. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard and click on "Load Balancers" under the "Load Balancing" section.

3.2. Click on "Create Load Balancer" and choose "Application Load Balancer".

3.3. Configure the load balancer settings:
   - **Name**: Enter a name for your ALB.
   - **Scheme**: Choose "internet-facing" if your website needs to be accessible from the internet.
   - **Listeners**: Configure HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) listeners.
   - **Availability Zones**: Select the subnets across availability zones.
   - Configure other settings as needed.

3.4. Configure security settings and add your EC2 instance(s) as targets.

3.5. Review and create the ALB.

### 4. Obtain a Domain Name and Set Up Route 53:

4.1. Go to the Route 53 Dashboard.

4.2. Create a hosted zone for your domain name (e.g., example.com).

4.3. Note down the name servers provided by Route 53.

4.4. Update your domain registrar's DNS settings to use the Route 53 name servers.

### 5. Configure Route 53 Records:

5.1. Within your hosted zone, create an "A" record for your website domain and point it to the ALB's DNS name.

5.2. Create an "Alias" record pointing your domain name to the ALB.

### 6. Obtain and Configure AWS Free SSL Certificate:

6.1. Go to the AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) Dashboard.

6.2. Request a new SSL/TLS certificate for your domain name. Choose "Request a public certificate" and enter your domain name(s).

6.3. Follow the validation steps to validate your domain ownership.

6.4. Once the certificate is issued, associate it with the ALB listener(s) for HTTPS.

### 7. Update Security Groups and NACLs:

7.1. Ensure that security groups associated with your EC2 instance(s) and ALB allow necessary traffic (HTTP/HTTPS) from the internet.

7.2. Make sure network ACLs (NACLs) allow traffic required for your setup.

### 8. Test Your Setup:

8.1. Once everything is configured, test your website by accessing it via the domain name.

8.2. Ensure that traffic is routed through the ALB and the SSL certificate is applied correctly.

That's the detailed setup process for setting up a custom VPC, EC2 instance, ALB, Route 53, and SSL certificate for hosting a website on AWS. Let me know if you need further clarification on any step!
