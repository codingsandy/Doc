In the given scenario, we have the subnet 10.0.0.0/28, which includes IP addresses from 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.0.15, with 10.0.0.0 as the network address and 10.0.0.15 as the broadcast address for that subnet.

When we talk about the next subnet, starting from 10.0.0.16/28, it's important to understand that the broadcast address for this new subnet is indeed 10.0.0.31. However, we are not using this address as the starting address for the next subnet. Rather, we're using 10.0.0.16 as the network address for the next subnet, as it's the next available address after the broadcast address of the previous subnet.

So, to correct the information provided earlier:

Current subnet: 10.0.0.0/28 (with a broadcast address of 10.0.0.15)
Next subnet: Starts at 10.0.0.16/28
The broadcast address for the next subnet (10.0.0.16/28) will indeed be 10.0.0.31, but that's not the starting address for the subnet.

Sure, let's illustrate with some examples:

Current Subnet: 10.0.0.0/28

Network Address: 10.0.0.0
Broadcast Address: 10.0.0.15
Usable IP Range: 10.0.0.1 to 10.0.0.14
Next Subnet: 10.0.0.16/28

Network Address: 10.0.0.16
Broadcast Address: 10.0.0.31
Usable IP Range: 10.0.0.17 to 10.0.0.30
In this example, we have a current subnet range from 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.0.15 with a subnet mask of /28. The next subnet range starts at 10.0.0.16, not at the broadcast address of the previous subnet (10.0.0.15). The broadcast address for the next subnet is indeed 10.0.0.31, which is the highest address in the range of 10.0.0.16/28.
